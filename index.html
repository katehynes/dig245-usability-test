        <p class="text pgh-space">In the web design world, usability refers to how easily users can navigate around a site.
          According to Jakob Nielsen in his article "Usability 101: Introduction to Usability" (linked here),
          usability is measured according to a website's learnability, efficiency, memorability, its users’ satisfaction,
          and their performance errors.
          <br><br>It's easy to imagine why usability should be important to web designers –
          if people can't find the information they need on your website, they'll look somewhere else.
          Nielsen recommends a process called usability testing to understand how their website appears from a user's perspective.
          The process is simple: bring in a small representative sample of users to navigate through your design, observe their experiences,
          modify your design accordingly, and repeat.</p>

        <p class="text pgh-space"> We asked two people to do a usability test on the North Carolina DMV website.
          We timed them as they performed 5 basic tasks to simulate a user’s experience with the site.

    <h2 class="text">KEY FINDINGS</h2>
    <p class="text pgh-space">Time to complete tasks <b>varied pretty significantly</b> between the two users.
      This was in part due to differences in pages they visited while trying to complete earlier tasks.
      <br><br> Information seemed to be <b>repeated acoss several pages,</b> which helped ensure users could access information
      regardless of where they searched for it, but some navigation routes appeared unneccessarily complicated.
      <br><br> User2 commented that the amount of information was <b>somewhat overwhelming</b> and “a little bit scattered,”
      although the overall experience was “better than expected.”

        <h2 class="text">DISCUSSION, RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
        <p class="text pgh-space">The users walked away from the task feeling <b>neutral</b> about, but <b>ultimately satisfied</b> with, their experience.
          Most tasks were relatively painless for the users – the longest each user spent on a task was 2 minutes.
          Spending two minutes on a task is acceptable because this website is an <b>official government page</b> and not intended
          to market a product or capture users’ attention.
          <br><br>The website’s main weakness is its <b>overwhelming amount of information.</b>
          However, because this website’s primary function is to inform users, and it has to serve an extremely wide audience,
          I <b>would not recommend changing this aspect.</b> This is better than limiting the information to one location, which would
          make it harder to find, and might lead to a more frustrating user experience.
          <br><br>We recommend that the site display an office location’s opening and closing hours when hovering over the location on the interactive map.
